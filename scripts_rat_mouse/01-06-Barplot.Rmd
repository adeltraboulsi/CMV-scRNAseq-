```


```{r}
percent_cmv_each_cluster <- count_table[, "CMV"] / total_CMV * 100
percent_mem_each_cluster <- count_table[, "MEM"] / total_MEM * 100
```


```{r}

        beside = TRUE, xlab = "Number of Clusters", ylab = "Percentage of Cells",
        main = "Cell Percentage per Cluster", legend.text = c("CMV", "MEM"))
