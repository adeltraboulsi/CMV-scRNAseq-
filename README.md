## Introduction

This repository contains tools and workflows for analyzing single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. With scRNA-seq, you can delve into the intricacies of gene expression at the single-cell level, offering valuable insights into cellular diversity, development, and responses to different conditions.
## Key Analysis Steps

In your scRNA-seq analysis workflow, you may encounter several key steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean, quality control, and normalize scRNA-seq data to ensure accuracy.

2. **Data Integration**: Combine data from multiple experiments for comparison and exploration.

3. **Cell Clustering and Identification**: Group similar cells to identify distinct populations.

4. **PHATE Embedding**: Visualize high-dimensional data in lower-dimensional space using PHATE.

5. **Cell Cycling Score**: Estimate cell cycle stages for understanding cellular dynamics.

6. **Differential Expression Analysis**: Identify genes differentially expressed between cell populations or conditions.

7. **Functional Analysis**: Associate differentially expressed genes with relevant pathways and functions.
## Getting Started

To get started with scRNA-seq analysis, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
   
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/adeltraboulsi/CMV-scRNAseq.git

To perform the analysis, follow these steps:

1. **Load and Run R Scripts**:

   - **Load the scripts from `scripts_rat_mouse`**:
     First, you'll need to load the scripts located in the `scripts_rat_mouse` directory. These scripts are likely written in R and contain functions or code that are required for the initial setup or data processing in R.

     ```R
     # Set your working directory to the scripts_rat_mouse directory
     setwd("scripts_rat_mouse")

     # Load or review the R scripts
     # Use a text editor or any R-compatible code editor to view the scripts
     ```

   - **Run the scripts from `scripts_rat_only`**:
     Next, you'll run the analysis scripts located in the `scripts_rat_only` directory. These scripts are likely written in R and are responsible for specific analysis tasks related to the rat-only dataset.

     ```R
     # Set your working directory to the scripts_rat_only directory
     setwd("scripts_rat_only")

     # Run the R scripts
     # Use an appropriate command to execute the R scripts
     ```

   Replace `script_name` with the actual names of the R scripts you need to load and run. Additionally, provide any specific instructions or parameters that may be relevant for running these R scripts effectively.

   By following these steps, you'll be able to execute the analysis in the correct order, starting with loading the necessary R scripts from `scripts_rat_mouse` and then proceeding to run the analysis scripts from `scripts_rat_only`.
