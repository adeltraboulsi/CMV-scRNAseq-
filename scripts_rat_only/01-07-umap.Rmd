##Graph-based Clustering and Visualization of Integrated Rat Dataset: Comparing CMV and MEM Cell Clusters


```{r}
# To embed cells in a graph structure using a K-nearest neighbor (KNN) graph, with edges drawn between cells with similar feature expression patterns, and to partition this graph into highly interconnected sub-population.
aligned_rat_merged <- FindNeighbors(aligned_rat_merged, dims = 1:50, k.param = 10, verbose = F)
# To cluster the cells, by applying the Louvain algorithm (default), to iteratively group cells together, with the goal of optimizing the standard modularity function.
aligned_rat_merged <- FindClusters(aligned_rat_merged, verbose = F)
#To visualize the comparison of cluster cells between "CMV" & "MEM" in rat.
DimPlot(aligned_rat_merged, split.by = "orig.ident",label = T)
