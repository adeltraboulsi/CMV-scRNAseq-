##Genomic Annotation Analysis: Extracting Gene IDs from Rat Genome GTF File
 
Mitochondrial Gene ID Extraction for Quality Control (QC) Filtering 
```{r}
# Import the GTF file containing genomic annotations for the rat genome
mm_gtf <- rtracklayer::import('S:/Mcyto/Experiments/R&D/2023/George-Alehandro_cmv_rat_alignment/GCF_015227675.2_mRatBN7.2_genomic.gtf')

# Subset the GTF data to retain annotations for the "NC_001665.2" sequence
mt_gtf <- mm_gtf[mm_gtf@seqnames == "NC_001665.2",]

# Extract the gene IDs from the subset and convert them to a character vector
mt_gtf_genes <- as.character(mt_gtf$gene_id)
```
